Current Status

- We can generate some of the views, but still have issue with deployment views, in constructing the clusters
- This is done by looking at code from DotWriter, and creating my own DotDiagramWriter based on it.
- Customized parameter on DotGraph from dot diagram, and including description on the nodes 
makes it much better than what original dotwriter looks

TODO
- Write code to send to web sequence diagram
- Fix deployment diagram
- Play with the DSL that was originally planned for this.
